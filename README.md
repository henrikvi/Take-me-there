# take-me-there
My first project using javascript, an api-mashup for a school course.
Lots of learning and wow-feelings for being able to use available data to create something cool.

Purpose:
- display instagram photos by tag
- provide possible travel routes to the location of a chosen photo using rome2rio routes and google maps.

#### Major points learned
- very basic JS concepts
- reading api documentation
- first attempts at structuring and commenting code
